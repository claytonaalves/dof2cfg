# dof2cfg

Tool to generate a <project>.cfg file from the <project>.dof file of a Delphi 5.0 to 7.0 project. The .cfg file is used by the command line compiler.

Note: The Delphi IDE does that every time it writes the .dof file so this is only useful if you do not want to start the IDE for this purpose.

There is als Bdsproj2cfg which does the same for .bdsproj files used by Delphi 2005 and 2006, search for it on CodeCentral.
